# About

Spotify-api.js was initially started as an alternative for basic spotify api fetching! Then soon people needed upgrades, so we worked on it and we have made a fully working typed library for spotify api! [Here](https://github.com/spotify-api/spotify-api.js/wiki/Migration-guide-for-v8) is our migration guide for v8 for major changes!

# Features 

- Full Typescript Support
- Object oriented
- Easy to learn
- Covers all of the spotify api methods as javascript functions
- Works with browser too!

# Examples

## Getting started

Installing the package!

```sh
npm i spotify-api.js@latest
```

Getting your client id and client secret from [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

## Setting up Spotify Client!

```js
const Spotify = require("spotify-api.js");
const client = new Spotify.Client('token');

client.tracks.get('id').then(console.log);
```

Or create a token while logging in!

```js
const Spotify = require("spotify-api.js");
const client = new Spotify.Client();

client.login('client_id', 'client_secret').then(async () => {
    console.log(await client.tracks.get('id'));
});
```

## Getting a current user token!

Get a current user authorized token or just refresh to get a new one!

```js
const Spotify = require('spotify-api.js');
const Client = new Spotify.Client();

client.login({
    clientID: 'id', // Your app client id
    clientSecret: 'secret', // Your app client secret
    code: 'token or code',  // To get new one, enter the code received by spotify api or to refresh to get a new one, enter the refreshToken!
    redirectURL: 'redirect url' // Redirect url which you used while auth, which is only for verification
}).then(async ({ refreshToken }) => {
    console.log(`Login successful! Refresh token: ${refreshToken}`);
    console.log(await client.tracks.get('id'));
})
```

## Using Spotify Current User

Spotify-api.js helps you access the current user and its player efficiently.

```js
const client = new Spotify.Client("USERTOKEN");
await client.artists.follow("SOME ARTIST ID");
```

## Caching

We have built an easy cache system to prevent you from spamming the spotify api!

> Note: By Default cache option is turned off to prevent unwanted memory leak so we recommend you to only use it in case of high usage.

```js
const Spotify = require('spotify-api.js');

// Defining cache options
const DefaultCacheOptions = {
    cacheTracks: true, // incase I only want to cache the tracks only I will this to true
    cacheUsers: false,
    cacheCategories: false,
    cacheEpisodes: false,
    cacheShows: false,
    cachePlaylists: false,
    cacheArtists: false,
    cacheAlbums: false,
    cacheCurrentUser: false,
    cacheFollowers: null
};

const client = new Spotify.Client("TOKEN", DefaultCacheOptions) // Passing the cache options
await client.tracks.get("ID"); // The track is now cached
client.cache.tracks.get("ID"); // Returns TrackStructure which is been fetched previously else will return null
await client.tracks.get("ID"); // Second time using the function will return cache one
await client.tracks.get("ID", true); // Using second param will force fetch instead of searching cache!
```

Incase if you have selected cacheCurrentUser option, the client will fetch and cache the current user details on the client start so sometimes the program will start early before client caches so you can do something like this!

```js
const Client = new Spotify.Client("USER_TOKEN", {
    cacheCurrentuser: true,
    async ready(){
        console.log('Cache of current user is ready');
    }
});
```

You can use the `createUser` method to get only the current user with cached by default!!

```js
const user = await Spotify.createUser('token');
console.log(`Created a user with spotify id as ${user.id}`);
```
